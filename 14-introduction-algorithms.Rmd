# (PART\*) Algorithms {-}

# Section 3 - Algorithms {#third-section -}

In this section, the main types of objects used in R will be introduced, specifically the primary structures in which data can be organized: Vectors, Matrices, Data Frames, and Lists.

For each of them, we will describe their characteristics and see how to create, modify, and manipulate them according to specific needs.

The chapters are organized as follows:

- **Chapter \@ref(functions) - Functions**. We will learn how to create custom functions in R to perform specific tasks.
- **Chapter \@ref(conditionals) - Conditional Programming**. We will learn how to manage the execution of an algorithm through the use of `if` and `else` operators.
- **Chapter \@ref(loop) - Iterative Programming**. We will introduce the use of `for` and `while` operators for executing loops.
